   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apex-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # iRacing API Credentials
   IRACING_EMAIL=your_iracing_email@example.com
   IRACING_PASSWORD=your_iracing_password
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:9002`

## 📡 API Integration

This application uses the official iRacing API through the `iracing-api` TypeScript package with **persistent authentication** for optimal performance. All data is fetched in real-time and includes:

- Driver statistics and historical data
- Race results and detailed lap analysis  
- Car and track information
- Series and season data

### 🔐 Persistent Authentication
The app features an advanced authentication system that:
- **Maintains sessions for up to 4 hours** - eliminating frequent re-authentication
- **Automatically refreshes** sessions 30 minutes before expiry
- **Smart retry logic** with configurable backoff for reliability
- **Background processing** - refresh happens without blocking requests

### ⚙️ Authentication Configuration
Customize authentication behavior via environment variables:

```env
# Optional - Session management (defaults work well)
IRACING_SESSION_DURATION_HOURS=4          # Session lifetime
IRACING_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=30      # Refresh timing
IRACING_MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3              # Retry attempts
IRACING_ENABLE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=true   # Enable persistence
```

### Authentication Notes
- **Persistent Sessions**: Authentication automatically lasts up to 4 hours
- **Automatic Recovery**: Smart retry logic handles temporary failures
- **CAPTCHA Handling**: Clear instructions when verification is required
- **Background Refresh**: Sessions refresh automatically without interruption
- **Zero Maintenance**: No manual session management required

## 🏗️ Architecture
